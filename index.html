  <h3>Bee Movie
    By Jerry Seinfeld</h3>
<p>
  NARRATOR:<br>  (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)<br>  According to all known laws<br>  of aviation,<br>  :<br>  there is no way a bee<br>  should be able to fly.<br>  :<br>  Its wings are too small to get<br>  its fat little body off the ground.<br>  :<br>  The bee, of course, flies anyway<br>  :<br>  because bees don't care<br>  what humans think is impossible.<br>  BARRY BENSON:<br>  (Barry is picking out a shirt)<br>  Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>  Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>  :<br>  Ooh, black and yellow!<br>  Let's shake it up a little.<br>  JANET BENSON:<br>  Barry! Breakfast is ready!<br>  BARRY:<br>  Coming!<br>  :<br>  Hang on a second.<br>  (Barry uses his antenna like a phone)<br>  :<br>  Hello?<br>  ADAM FLAYMAN:<br>  <br>  (Through phone)<br>  - Barry?<br>  BARRY:<br>  - Adam?<br>  ADAM:<br>  - Can you believe this is happening?<br>  BARRY:<br>  - I can't. I'll pick you up.<br>  (Barry flies down the stairs)<br>  :<br>  MARTIN BENSON:<br>  Looking sharp.<br>  JANET:<br>  Use the stairs.

We'll be in row 118,000.<br>  - Bye!<br>  (Barry flies out the door)<br>  JANET:<br>  Barry, I told you,<br>  stop flying in the house!<br>  (Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a<br>  newspaper)<br>  BARRY==<br>  - Hey, Adam.<br>  ADAM:<br>  - Hey, Barry.<br>  (Adam gets in Barry's car)<br>  :<br>  - Is that fuzz gel?<br>  BARRY:<br>  - A little.

You're right.<br>  TOUR GUIDE:<br>  - At Honex, we constantly strive<br>  :<br>  to improve every aspect<br>  of bee existence.<br>  :<br>  These bees are stress-testing<br>  a new helmet technology.<br>  (The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is being smashed into the<br>  ground with fly-swatters, newspapers and boots. He lifts a thumbs up but<br>  you can hear him groan)<br>  :<br>  ADAM==<br>  <br>  - What do you think he makes?<br>  BARRY:<br>  - Not enough.<br>  TOUR GUIDE:<br>  Here we have our latest advancement,<br>  the Krelman.<br>  (They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs, who are each<br>  wearing a finger-shaped hat)<br>  Barry:<br>  - Wow, What does that do?<br>  TOUR GUIDE:<br>  - Catches that little strand of honey<br>  :<br>  that hangs after you pour it.<br>  Saves us millions.<br>  ADAM:<br>  (Intrigued)<br>  Can anyone work on the Krelman?<br>  TOUR GUIDE:<br>  Of course. Most bee jobs are<br>  small ones.<br>  But bees know that every small job,<br>  if it's done well, means a lot.<br>  :<br>  But choose carefully<br>  :<br>  because you'll stay in the job<br>  you pick for the rest of your life.<br>  (Everyone claps except for Barry)<br>  BARRY:<br>  The same job the rest of your life?<br>  I didn't know that.<br>  ADAM:<br>  <br>  What's the difference?<br>  TOUR GUIDE:<br>  You'll be happy to know that bees,<br>  as a species, haven't had one day off<br>  :<br>  in 27 million years.<br>  BARRY:<br>  (Upset)<br>  So you'll just work us to death?<br>  :<br>  We'll sure try.<br>  (Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry. Barry and Adam are walking back<br>  home together)<br>  ADAM:<br>  Wow! That blew my mind!<br>  BARRY:<br>  "What's the difference?"<br>  How can you say that?<br>  :<br>  One job forever?<br>  That's an insane choice to have to make.<br>  ADAM:<br>  I'm relieved. Now we only have<br>  to make one decision in life.<br>  BARRY:<br>  But, Adam, how could they<br>  never have told us that?<br>  ADAM:<br>  Why would you question anything?<br>  We're bees.<br>  :<br>  We're the most perfectly<br>  functioning society on Earth.<br>  <br>  BARRY:<br>  You ever think maybe things<br>  work a little too well here?<br>  ADAM:<br>  Like what? Give me one example.<br>  (Barry and Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the audience that<br>  hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing them in perfect<br>  unison)<br>  BARRY:<br>  I don't know. But you know<br>  what I'm talking about.<br>  ANNOUNCER:<br>  Please clear the gate.<br>  Royal Nectar Force on approach.<br>  BARRY:<br>  Wait a second.

You have to be bred for that.<br>  ADAM==<br>  Right.<br>  (Barry and Adam are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen<br>  Jocks)<br>  BARRY:<br>  Look at that. That's more pollen<br>  than you and I will see in a lifetime.<br>  ADAM:<br>  It's just a status symbol.<br>  Bees make too much of it.<br>  BARRY:<br>  Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it<br>  and the ladies see you wearing it.<br>  (Barry waves at 2 girls standing a little away from them)<br>  <br>  ADAM==<br>  Those ladies?<br>  Aren't they our cousins too?<br>  BARRY:<br>  Distant. Distant.<br>  POLLEN JOCK #1:<br>  Look at these two.<br>  POLLEN JOCK #2:<br>  - Couple of Hive Harrys.<br>  POLLEN JOCK #1:<br>  - Let's have fun with them.<br>  GIRL BEE #1:<br>  It must be dangerous<br>  being a Pollen Jock.<br>  BARRY:<br>  Yeah.

Gusty.<br>  POLLEN JOCK #1:<br>  We're hitting a sunflower patch<br>  six miles from here tomorrow.<br>  BARRY:<br>  - Six miles, huh?<br>  ADAM:<br>  - Barry!<br>  POLLEN JOCK #2:<br>  A puddle jump for us,<br>  but maybe you're not up for it.<br>  BARRY:<br>  - Maybe I am.<br>  ADAM:<br>  - You are not!<br>  POLLEN JOCK #1:<br>  We're going 0900 at J-Gate.<br>  :<br>  What do you think, buzzy-boy?<br>  Are you bee enough?<br>  BARRY:<br>  I might be. It all depends<br>  on what 0900 means.<br>  (The scene cuts to Barry looking out on the hive-city from his balcony at<br>  night)<br>  MARTIN:<br>  <br>  Hey, Honex!<br>  BARRY:<br>  Dad, you surprised me.<br>  MARTIN:<br>  You decide what you're interested in?<br>  BARRY:<br>  - Well, there's a lot of choices.<br>  - But you only get one.<br>  :<br>  Do you ever get bored<br>  doing the same job every day?<br>  MARTIN:<br>  Son, let me tell you about stirring.<br>  :<br>  You grab that stick, and you just<br>  move it around, and you stir it around.<br>  :<br>  You get yourself into a rhythm.<br>  It's a beautiful thing.<br>  BARRY:<br>  You know, Dad,<br>  the more I think about it,<br>  :<br>  maybe the honey field<br>  just isn't right for me.<br>  MARTIN:<br>  You were thinking of what,<br>  making balloon animals?<br>  :<br>  That's a bad job<br>  for a guy with a stinger.<br>  :<br>  <br>  Janet, your son's not sure<br>  he wants to go into honey!<br>  JANET:<br>  - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.<br>  BARRY:<br>  - I'm not trying to be funny.<br>  MARTIN:<br>  You're not funny!
